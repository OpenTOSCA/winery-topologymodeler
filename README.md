This repository encapsulates the Topology Modeler of Eclipse Winery. It requires [Winery] to run as a backend service.

Winery is a Web-based environment to graphically model TOSCA topologies and plans managing these topologies.
It is an Eclipse project and thus support is available through its project page <https://eclipse.org/winery>.
Winery is also part of the OpenTOSCA ecosystem where more information is available at <http://www.opentosca.org>.

**There was no security of Eclipse Winery. There might be [remote code execution vulnerabilities](https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec). Thus, when hosting Eclipse Winery, make it accessible to turstworthy parties only.**

Both development and user documentation is rendered at <https://eclipse.github.io/winery/>.

The source code documentation can be generated by running `npm run doc` which creates a [docs/](docs) folder.
